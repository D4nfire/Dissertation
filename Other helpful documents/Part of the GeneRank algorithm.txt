% 
% GeneRank is a modification of the PageRank algorithm.
% input data is   W: connectivity  matrix (zero/one, symmetric with zero diag)        // also called an adjacency matrix https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix
%                 ex: vector of expression levels (non-negative)
%                 d: parameter in algorithm
%
% output is   r: vector of rankings

			# = MY NOTES
ex = abs(ex);   # Y = abs(X) returns the absolute value of each element in array X. 
		# in this case makes all values positive
norm_ex = ex/max(ex);	# M = max(A) returns the largest elements of A.
w = sparse(W);	# S = sparse(A) converts a full matrix into sparse form by squeezing out 
		# any zero elements. If a matrix contains many zeros, converting the matrix
		# to sparse storage saves memory.
degrees = sum(W);	# S = sum(A) returns the sum of the elements of A along the first 
			# array dimension whose size does not equal 1.
ind = find(degrees == 0);	# k = find(X) returns a vector containing the linear indices 
				# of each nonzero element in array X.
degrees(ind) = 1;
D1 = sparse(diag(1./degrees));
A = eye(size(w)) - d*(w'*D1);
b = (1-d)*norm_ex;
r = A\b;
