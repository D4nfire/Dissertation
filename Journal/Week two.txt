The second week was spent getting to know the subject area better by reading a couple
more papers relavent to the topic. I also looked at some small python tutorials to get
a better grip on the language.

Further to this I wrote the Outline sproject specifcation using a couple of papers
in the reffereance section.

I also had a look at some potential expression data and found parts of the algorithms
which will be required to manipulate the data.
