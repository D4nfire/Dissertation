Week four was spent on the python implementation of the algorithm.
Data was parsed from the gene annotations file as well as a gene expression file
It was then manipulated to get out the required items, for the gene annotations file
this consisted of connected genes via GO ID and putting them into a graph. This was
displayed using CytoScape. The adjacency matrix for the graph was also created for later
use. The graph and adjacency matrix was made using Netwrokx
For the gene expression file, the expression data along with the genes "systematic name"
was extracted. The expression data for each gene was averaged, as I expect this is what
will be required later on, however the range of this data may be required instead. The
systematic name provided is not the same as the general name given by the gene annotations
file so a file called "multipleNameTypes" was created using YeastMine which includes all
variations of gene identification.
