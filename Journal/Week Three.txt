Week three was sepnt getting to grips with the data, this included looking at the data types and 
extensions avaliable.

The majority of week three was spent researching more papers, reading papers and creating a list
of terms and refferences too look into. On papers which were read I highlighted parts which could
be re-read to give a general understanding and jog my memory. These parts could be included in and
indtroduction.

I also spent some time watching and going along with python tutorials on youtube getting a better
understanding and grip on the language. This will be encessary to do the algorithm part of the
project. Further reading along with this exploration of python has led to a better understanding 
of what the goals and achievements of GR is and how it was produced.
